This is just me learning as i have not made something like this before and it may not be added to a released version of the pagination
## The current functions
```js
.setMessage()
.setInteraction()
.setPageList()
.setButtonList()
.setTimeout()
.setProgressBar()
.setReplyMessage()
.setAutoDelete()
.setPrivateReply()
.setAuthorIndependent()
.paginate()
```
